# LUDO

## Overview

Platform that allows users to keep track of their amature leagues, teams and players stats. Sign up to the app, create as many profiles as you want and add stats. Other users from the same team or league can access your entries as well, so everybody knows who the MVP is.

## TECHS: 
JAVASCRIPT, NODE, EXPRESS, MONGODB, MONGOOSE, EJS, BOOTSTRAP, CSS, SCSS

## Optimizations

* To have a more dynamic experience, I would like the users to have the option of editing the stats table header.
* Mobile version is in the works.

## Challenges

Working with Cloudinary and Multer to upload images was a new experience. As I wanted users to have the opportunity to upload profile pics, but not have it mandatory, I needed a system to have a default image and avoid a crash. By checking if a file was added before setting an upload function, I was able to add the default option.
